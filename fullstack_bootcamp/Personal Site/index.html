    <h1>William Han</h1>
    <p><em>Research Intern at <strong><a href="https://safeai-lab.github.io/">CMU SAIL</a></strong></em></p>
    <p> I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine majoring in Psychological Science BA. I am on track to graduate in June 2022! I recently uncovered a deep love for academics, therefore I am studying a breadth of subjects, including but not limited to: Machine Learning, Mathematics, Pathology, Philosophy and AMO Physics. I have been especially fascinated in multimodal learning, computer vision for medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, algorithmic topolgy, analysis and design of algorithms, and computational game theory.</p>
    <p>Most of my time is being spent at CMUâ€™s Safe AI Lab (SAIL).</p>
    <p>I like to hang out with my friends, read, learn chinese, practice coding, watch YouTube videos, and play League of Legends.</p>
    <p>I love talking to people so please do not hesitate to reach out to wjhan{at}uci{dot}edu.</p>
